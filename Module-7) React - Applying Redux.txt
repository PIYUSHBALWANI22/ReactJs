Q.1) What is Redux? 

--> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, primarily used in building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications. It's often used in conjunction with React, but it can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library.

At its core, Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can't be changed directly. Changes to the state are made by dispatching actions, which are plain JavaScript objects describing what happened. These actions are then handled by functions called reducers, which specify how the application's state should change in response to actions. Reducers are pure functions, meaning they produce the same output for the same input and don't have side effects.

Redux promotes a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to understand how data changes over time and to debug applications. It also provides features like middleware, which allows for customization of behavior between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer.

Key concepts in Redux include:

1. Store: The store holds the state of the application. It allows access to the state via `getState()`, updates the state via `dispatch(action)`, and registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.

2. Actions: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent what has happened. They must have a `type` property indicating the type of action being performed. Additional data can be included as well.

3. Reducers: Reducers are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return the new state.

4. Middleware: Middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. It's commonly used for logging, asynchronous actions, and other side effects.

Overall, Redux simplifies the management of application state, making it more predictable and easier to reason about, particularly in large-scale applications with complex state management needs.


Q.2) What is Redux Thunk used for?

--> Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux, a popular state management library for JavaScript applications, particularly those built with React. It is used to handle asynchronous operations in Redux actions.

Hereâ€™s why Redux Thunk is used:

1.  Handling Asynchronous Actions: By default, Redux actions are synchronous. This means they immediately return an action object, which is processed by reducers to update the state. However, many real-world applications require asynchronous actions, such as fetching data from an API before updating the state. Redux Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action object. This function can perform side effects, including async operations, and dispatch actions when appropriate.

2.  Dispatching Multiple Actions:  Thunk middleware enables action creators to dispatch multiple actions, typically one to signify the start of an operation (like loading data) and another when the operation completes (success or failure). This helps in managing the UI state transitions effectively.

3.  Access to Dispatch and getState:  Thunks receive `dispatch` and `getState` functions as arguments, allowing them to dispatch actions themselves and to retrieve the current state of the Redux store if needed. This enables more complex logic in action creators, such as conditional dispatching or accessing parts of the store state.

To summarize, Redux Thunk extends Redux by allowing action creators to return functions instead of plain action objects. This capability is crucial for managing asynchronous behavior, such as API calls and other side effects, within Redux applications.


Q.3) What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over 
Component? 

--> A  Pure Component  in React is a class component that extends `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`. The key difference between a Pure Component and a regular Component (`React.Component`) lies in how they handle updates and re-renders.

  Characteristics of Pure Component:

1.  Shallow Prop and State Comparison:  Pure Components implement a `shouldComponentUpdate` method with a shallow comparison of props and state. This means that a Pure Component will re-render only if the props or state have changed at the top level, not if their contents have mutated. This can lead to performance optimizations by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

2.  Immutability for Performance:  To ensure the shallow comparison works correctly, the props and state within a Pure Component should be immutable or treated as such. Immutable data structures or objects with new references are preferred over mutating existing props or state.

  When to use Pure Component over Component:

Use a  Pure Component  over a regular  Component when:

1.  Performance Optimization:  If your component renders frequently and its render output depends solely on props and state, using a Pure Component can prevent unnecessary renders. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a complex UI or large component tree, and re-rendering is a performance bottleneck.

2.  Props and State are Immutable:  Pure Components rely on shallow comparisons of props and state. If your props and state are immutable (i.e., their references do not change unless the data actually changes), Pure Components can accurately determine when to re-render based on changes.

3.  Avoiding Manual shouldComponentUpdate:  Instead of manually implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` to optimize performance, Pure Components provide a more convenient way to achieve the same goal without writing additional logic.

  Considerations:

- Complex State or Props:  If your component's props or state contain nested objects or arrays that frequently mutate, a Pure Component might not offer significant performance benefits because shallow comparison may not catch deep changes. In such cases, carefully evaluate whether a Pure Component is suitable or if you need more fine-grained control with `shouldComponentUpdate`.

-  Functional Components:  With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components combined with the `React.memo` higher-order component provide similar optimization benefits as Pure Components for functional components.

In summary, use a Pure Component when you want to optimize performance by leveraging React's automatic shallow comparison of props and state, thus reducing unnecessary re-renders of components that are expensive to render or are frequently updated.


Q.4) What is the second argument that can optionally be passed 
tosetState and what is its purpose?

--> In React, `setState` is the method used to update the state of a component. It can accept an optional second argument, which is a callback function that will be executed once `setState` has been completed and the component has been re-rendered.

  Purpose of the Second Argument:

The second argument to `setState` serves primarily for scenarios where you need to perform some action (such as making additional computations or triggering another function) after the state has been updated and React has re-rendered the component. Here's why it's useful:

1. Execution Post-Update:  Since `setState` is asynchronous, React does not guarantee that the state will have been updated by the time the next line of code after `setState` is executed. By providing a callback as the second argument, you ensure that the provided function is executed only after the state has been successfully updated and the component has been re-rendered.

2.  Accessing Updated State:  Inside the callback function, you can safely access the updated state. This is particularly useful if you need to derive some values based on the updated state or if you need to perform calculations that depend on the new state values.

  Example Usage:

```
// Example of using setState with a callback
this.setState({ 
  counter: this.state.counter + 1 
}, () => {
  // This callback function will be executed after setState is done
  console.log('State has been updated and component re-rendered');
});

```

In this example:
- `this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 })` updates the `counter` state by incrementing it.
- The second argument, `() => { console.log('State has been updated and component re-rendered'); }`, is a callback function that will be called after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.

  When to Use:

Use the second argument to `setState` when you need to perform imperative operations that depend on the updated state or need to execute logic after the component has re-rendered due to the state change. It helps ensure that your code executes at the correct point in the component lifecycle, making it easier to manage side effects or coordinate updates.

  Important Note:

While the second argument is useful for managing side effects related to state changes, it's important to use it judiciously. Overuse of callbacks can lead to code that is harder to reason about, especially in complex component hierarchies. Ensure that the logic inside the callback remains clear and directly related to the state update to maintain code readability and maintainability.


Q.5) Create a Table and Search data from table using React Js ?

--> To create a table and implement a search functionality in React.js, follow the steps below. We'll use functional components and hooks for this example.

Step 1: Set Up Your React Application

First, create a new React application if you don't have one:

```bash
npx create-react-app product-search
cd product-search
npm start
```

Step 2: Create the ProductTable Component

Create a new file `ProductTable.js` in the `src` directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ProductTable = () => {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  const [filteredProducts, setFilteredProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Mock data to simulate fetching from an API
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const data = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Amanda Walter Shirt Men', price: '$333', category: 'Fashion' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Abercrombie Allen Brook Shirt', price: '$70', category: 'Fashion' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Abercrombie Lake Arnold Shirt', price: '$60', category: 'Fashion' },
        { id: 4, name: 'Benich Shirt', price: '$29', category: 'Fashion' }
      ];
      setProducts(data);
      setFilteredProducts(data);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    setFilteredProducts(
      products.filter(product =>
        product.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
      )
    );
  }, [searchTerm, products]);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px' }}>
      <h1>Search products: {searchTerm}</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
        style={{ padding: '5px', width: '300px' }}
      />
      <button
        style={{
          marginLeft: '10px',
          padding: '5px 10px',
          backgroundColor: '#007bff',
          color: '#fff',
          border: 'none',
          borderRadius: '4px',
          cursor: 'pointer'
        }}
      >
        Create Product
      </button>
      <table style={{ width: '100%', marginTop: '20px', borderCollapse: 'collapse' }}>
        <thead>
          <tr style={{ borderBottom: '2px solid #ddd' }}>
            <th style={{ padding: '10px' }}>Name</th>
            <th style={{ padding: '10px' }}>Price</th>
            <th style={{ padding: '10px' }}>Category</th>
            <th style={{ padding: '10px' }}>Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {filteredProducts.map((product) => (
            <tr key={product.id} style={{ borderBottom: '1px solid #ddd' }}>
              <td style={{ padding: '10px' }}>{product.name}</td>
              <td style={{ padding: '10px' }}>{product.price}</td>
              <td style={{ padding: '10px' }}>{product.category}</td>
              <td style={{ padding: '10px' }}>
                <button
                  style={{
                    padding: '5px 10px',
                    backgroundColor: '#17a2b8',
                    color: '#fff',
                    border: 'none',
                    borderRadius: '4px',
                    marginRight: '5px',
                    cursor: 'pointer'
                  }}
                >
                  Read
                </button>
                <button
                  style={{
                    padding: '5px 10px',
                    backgroundColor: '#28a745',
                    color: '#fff',
                    border: 'none',
                    borderRadius: '4px',
                    marginRight: '5px',
                    cursor: 'pointer'
                  }}
                >
                  Edit
                </button>
                <button
                  style={{
                    padding: '5px 10px',
                    backgroundColor: '#dc3545',
                    color: '#fff',
                    border: 'none',
                    borderRadius: '4px',
                    cursor: 'pointer'
                  }}
                >
                  Delete
                </button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductTable;
```

Step 3: Use the ProductTable Component in App.js

Replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the following code to use the `ProductTable` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import ProductTable from './ProductTable';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <ProductTable />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

 Step 4: Start Your React Application

Ensure your React application is running:

```bash
npm start
```

This setup will give you a search functionality and display the data in a table as shown in the image you provided. The table will dynamically update as you type in the search box.
